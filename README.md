# Py-Sand-Game

Py-Sand-Game is a sandbox game written in Python using the Pygame library. It allows you to create and interact with various elements, such as sand, water, fire, and more, in a simulated environment.

## Game Overview

The objective of the game is to experiment and observe the behaviors of different elements within the sandbox. You can place and interact with elements using the mouse and keyboard controls.

## Features

- Create and manipulate different elements, including sand, water, fire, and stone.
- Simulate realistic behavior of elements, such as gravity, flow, and reactions.
- Use the cursor to place and control the elements on the grid.
- Explore the interactions and reactions between different elements.
- Experiment with different scenarios and observe the dynamic behavior of the elements.

## Goals

- Enhance the visual effects to make the game more immersive.
- Implement additional elements with unique behaviors, such as gas or ice.
- Add tools or controls to adjust environmental factors like temperature or pressure.
- Introduce interactive features, such as element transformations or reactions.
- Implement a save/load functionality to preserve and share interesting sandbox creations.
- Allow users to create custom elements and behaviors through a modding system.
